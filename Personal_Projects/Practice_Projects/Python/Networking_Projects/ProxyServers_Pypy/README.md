#   Overview
The use of proxy servers via Python to disguise and change one's IP address
and various information like one's location.

The use of proxy servers is that one connects indirectly to a particular endpoint in the internet
through another server device, rather than connecting directly.
This improves one's anonymity, but it does not make one completely anonymous as using a few servers
to redirect your traffic can still be tracked by someone who is monitoring your traffic, who has access to them.
Moreover, the servers you use can see your traffic, specifically, the details of your IP

It uses the `requests` module. It's part of the core python stack, though
