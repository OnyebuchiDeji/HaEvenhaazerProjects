#   Overview
Advanced TCP Chat Room. A continuation of the Simple TCP Chat Room in Python episode.

This episode adds more features, like an admin that needs to log in, and that is able to run commands that normal users can not.
They can run commands like these:
    1.  `/kick <user>` to kick a user off the server. The user can still login/connect again.
    2.  `/ban <user>` to ban a user. Once ban, the user cannot log in/connect again.
