#   Overview
This small project is the creation of a TCP scoket stream chat app that uses an Android GUI,
Kivy.

The Kiv app is run on a remote server, specifically a VPS server
He demonstrates the use of Hostinger to create one's VPS server.
Then SSH into the ddevice
Then get the device's IP address.

However, for mine, I implement it locally on my computer.

Did:
    `python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples`
