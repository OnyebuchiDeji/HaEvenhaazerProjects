#   Overview
A Motion Detection Alarm System in Python
It uses OpenCV and simple features to detect exagerrated motion
in which cases it causes an alarm to sound.

It basically detects the change between frames; the greater or more
exagerrated the change causes the alarm.

It's a coold things, and I want to see if I can detect the shape of objects
that are moving, seperating this moving object from the static background.
