    #   Adding a Label and Button normally causes an Error.
    #   A popup can have only one Widget immediately within it.
    #   Solution: Add a Layout within the Popup to put the Label and Button within
    BoxLayout:
        orientation: "vertical"
        size: root.width, root.height

        Label:
            text: "This is important to consider!"
            font_size: 24
        Button:
            text: "Close Me!" 
            font_size: 24
            #   Pree that root refers to this Popup itself.

<MyLayout>

    BoxLayout:
        orientation: "vertical"
        size: root.width, root.height
    
        Label:
            text: "Popup Stuff"
            font_size: 32
        
        Button:
            text: "Popup Button"
            font_size: 32

            #   The below cannot be done without the `factory` module.
            #   this is because everything all within MyLayout can not see
            #   anything outside it, including the defiition of MyPopup
            #   And also because its not doing the same as creating a MyPopup
            #   within MyLayout like how Buttons and Labels are created...
            #   because then it would work (probably)
            # on_release: MyPopup().open()
            ##With Factory, it works this way:
            on_release: Factory.MyPopup().open()
