        ##  Defining them normally just renders them in the bottom left corner
        ##  To fix this, a pos_hint is needed for each button
        Button:
            text: "Top Left"
            #   The pos_hint is a Python dictionary-like structure
            #   they take values between 0 and 1
            #   {"x", "y", "top", "bottom", "left", "right"}
            pos_hint: {"x": 0, "top":1}
            # pos_hint: {"left": 1, "top":1}
        
        Button:
            text: "Top Right"
            #   This works because the button's width is 30% of the layout
            #   so to position the Top Right button, it's top left corner
            #   should be on the coordinate where x is 70% of the width of the containing layout
            pos_hint: {"x": 0.7, "top":1}
            #   OR just use the 'right' keyword.
            # pos_hint: {"right": 1, "top":1}
        Button:
            text: "Center"
            #   Because Button's width and height are .3, and the x and y centers of layout is .5,
            #   taking into account that origin of the shape is top left corner
            #   to correctly center the coordinates, do .5 - (0.3 /2) = 0.35 
            # pos_hint: {"x": 0.35, "y": 0.35}
            ##  Or
            #   For using `top`, the more one goes toward 1, the cloaser to the top one gets:
            #   Now, when top: 0.5 is used, the top Side of the Button is exactly halfway
            #   But to correctly center it, subtract half of the height, which is 0.5 - 0.3 / 2
            #   then subtract from 1 to make the offset in the right direction;
            #   this gives 0.65
            pos_hint: {"x": 0.35, "top": 0.65}
            
        Button:
            text: "Bottom Left"
            # pos_hint: {"x": 0}
            #   Same as, because they were in bottom by default
            # pos_hint: {"x": 0, "bottom":1}
        Button:
            text: "Bottom Right"
            pos_hint: {"right": 1, "bottom":1}
