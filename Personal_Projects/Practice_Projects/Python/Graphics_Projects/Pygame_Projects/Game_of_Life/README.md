Also a cellular automaton using quite simple rules.

Invented by British Mathematician John Horton Conway (26 December 1937 - 11 April 2020)

Rules:
    1.  In an empty vell next to which there are three living neighbors, life is born

    2.  If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, the cell continues to live.
        Else, if there are more than 3 or less than 2, the cell dies
