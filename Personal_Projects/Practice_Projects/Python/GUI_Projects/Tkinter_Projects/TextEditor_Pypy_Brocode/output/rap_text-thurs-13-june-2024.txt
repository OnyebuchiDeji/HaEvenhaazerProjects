Yh, Hmph. People Yh they know...
People, Yh they know... 
People, Yh they know...
(Yh, they know) x2

I feel good today....
My mind, repented...
My heart, relented...
My oil, overflowing...
My soul, not discouraged...
My find, too precious...
My might, never ending...
Why? because it comes from the river everlasting...
Olam, olam olam...
I move, never stressing...
I vibe, always caring...
I'm strong, not relenting...
It is... so good; my heart first imagined...
My mind became estatic...
...at the thought, that ...
everything that I saw the I've seen...
will become and be done...
And I'm so glad that I started...
and I know... that it is good.
