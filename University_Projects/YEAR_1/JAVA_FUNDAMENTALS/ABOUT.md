#	Brief

These tasks are practical tasks from my first year on the fundamentals of programming using the Java Programming language.
It goes through the intricacies of the language, from the type system semantics to fundamentals of programming.
Really, we cover every aspect of programming: sequential logic, iterations, type coversions, objects, their lifetime and their
scope type. We also looked at the STD IO (Standard in and out/Command line IO), FileIO, ImageIO, image processing, and lastly GUI and graphics using Java's AWT
and Swing libraries.
