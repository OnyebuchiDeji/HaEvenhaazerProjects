This is one of the largest practicals. Here, I explore JQuery and AJAX.
The first few examples show the use of Ajax and Jquery seperately. Afterwards,
AJAX and Jquery are used together.
In one of the examples, AJAX is used to access an API PHP script at a certain
URL to obtain word "quote of the day" and display it on the web page.
