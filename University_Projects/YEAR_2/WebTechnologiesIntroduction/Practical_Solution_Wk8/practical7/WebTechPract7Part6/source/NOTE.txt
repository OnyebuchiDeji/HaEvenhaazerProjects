For the Ajax and jquery, specifically the first 2 examples:
1. To test them I need to use a computer connected to the keele network
2.  I could not access the php file: getquote.php directly. I had no permissions for this
3.  I accessed it and requested data from it via the JS scripts gq meaning 'getquote'
3.  so I do not need to actually access the getquot.php directly.

First, note that for the afore-mentioned examples I neither used Ajax nor JQuery
From the above, it is shown that a client side program can be used to access a web service.
In this case, it is a simple service that provides quotes.
can also do same for services tht offer map, weather information, RSS feeds ,Twitter trends, stock market quotes, google analytics, etc.

But the output from the web service replaces the current page.
Rather it is preferred that the output is used to update the page.
This is where Ajax s useful, to update the page even asynchronously, not preventing other operations from being done!
Ajax allows one to access a remote resourve and to use it to update the current page without refreshing it!
This has advantages:
1. Saves bandwidth and latency
2. Improves user experience

Making an Ajax request uses the XMLHTTPRequest object.
With this, the browser sends a request for a resource.
When a response comes, the browser uses the object to pass the response to a callback function...
to dybamically modify the current page.
Examples 3 shows this
