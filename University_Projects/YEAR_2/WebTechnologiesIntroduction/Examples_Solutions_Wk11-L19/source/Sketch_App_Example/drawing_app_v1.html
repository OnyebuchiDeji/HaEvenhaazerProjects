        <!-- 
            This version of the drawing app uses the events to commence drawing.
            When the mouse is pressed, a boolean is made True which allows movement to draw lines.
            When the mouse button is released, this boolean is changed back to false... so mouse motion does not cause drawing.
            In the second version, anytime the mouse is pressed, then the move event listener is registered...
            hence motion produces line drawing.
            But when  mouse button is released the event listener is destroyed.
            The second version should be more costly than this first. 

            Notice that there are two ways of getting the actual mouse position in the canvas...
            only.
            The first

        <canvas id="dejiCanvas" width="960" height="540" style="border: 1px solid black">
            If the canvas could not be rendered, this text will be placeholder for it
        </canvas>

            var mycanvas = document.getElementById("dejiCanvas");
            var ctx = mycanvas.getContext("2d");
            mycanvas.width = window.innerWidth; mycanvas.height = window.innerHeight;

            mycanvas.addEventListener("mousedown", begin);
            var beginDrawing = false;
            mycanvas.addEventListener("mousemove", draw);

                 * The .getBoundingClientRect() gets these:
                 * it can be the window or the containing element of the element that calls .getBoundingClientRect()
                 * 
                 * x/left: distance between left-most part of window or the bounding rect and the canvas's left-most side.
                 * 
                 * y/top: gets the distance from window's or containing element's top to the top of the canvas element.
                 * 
                 * bottom: distance between window's top.
                 * 
                 * right: distance between the window's left-most side and the canvas's right-most side.
                 * 
                 * Hence event.clientX refers to the mouse's position relative to the containing box element, the window.
                 * This starts from (0, 0) to (mouseX, 0)
                 *  This is subtracted from rect.left which is the x position of the canvas (it's left-most side since it's a rectangle)
                 *  This gives the distance between the left boundary of the canvas and the mouseX position.
                 * 
                 * similarly for event.clientY which is the mouse's position relative to the window from the top which is at
                 * (0, 0) to (0, mouseY) -- the distance between the top of the window and the mouse's position within the canvas
                 * This is subtracted from rect.top, which is the distance between window's top and the up-most side of the canvas box
                 * Hence it gives the distance between the top boundary of canvas and the mouseY position.
