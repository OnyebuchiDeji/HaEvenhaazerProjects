#	Brief

Here, I explore the special functions: `htmlspecialchars()` and `htmlentities()`.
They basically do the same thing: they are sued to preprocess a string to remove any html
syntax or characters that do not normally appear in information text, specifically special characters
that can be used to embed html or even javascript or sql code.

They are important in ensuring security of applications. They are used extensively in the Advanced Web Technologies
module of my third year, as it is in this module that we explore ensuring web security; though we touched it in this Year 2 module.
