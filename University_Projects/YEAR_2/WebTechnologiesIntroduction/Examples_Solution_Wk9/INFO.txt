These examples show the use of built-in php functions used to validate input strings from forms, for example,
to ensure to remove any characters that hackers could use to break into a system, manipulating SQL requests and such.

There are functions like:
htmlspecialchars(<string_arg)
htmlentities(<string_arg>)
The two above convert characters that should not be added into the DOM, to a form that html
can display as normal strings. E.g:
$input_string = "PHP 'character string conversion' functions <i>htmlentities()</i>";
$output = htmlentities($input_string);
The output string will just display the whole string, including the <i></i> tags. Because of the functions above, php does not
process the tags to give the equivalent html effect. Hence it just gets printed out as a normal string.
Test this by running, "htmlentities_test.php".

As explained in the files, however, htmlspecialchars is limited to a number of chars it affects.
Check "htmlentities_vs_htmlspecialchars.php".
