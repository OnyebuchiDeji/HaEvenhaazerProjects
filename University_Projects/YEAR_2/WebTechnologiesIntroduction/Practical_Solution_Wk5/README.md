#	Brief
This practical is an introduction to PHP.
Here, I redo the lecture examples from my lecturer.

In the first example folder, we explored the basic syntax, then primitive data types like numbers and strings.
Then built in functions like the `date` function.
Then booleans and conditional statements; then looping semantics.
Lastly were array operations.


The next example explored sending requests and the use of assocuative arrays.
This same example explored file IO, writing and reading to `.txt` and `.csv` files.


Then the actual practicals were made of many tasks that showed how to make PHP
files generate html files using PHP scripting. The things learnt from the examples were applied.
Forms were made using PHP scripts, and a list of links generated using loop iterations.
