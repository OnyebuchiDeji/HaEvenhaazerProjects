#	Brief
These practical solutions show various uses of the JavaScript language.
One example shows the conversion of strings and objects into JSON and converting them back, useful for serialization.
The next shows a multiplication table.Then there is a random number generator.
Then the last is a weather forecast app that uses JavaScript Canvas to display graphs showing the weather forecast.
In this file, you can see me exploring the language, making different versions of the script and creating Function objects
as well as classes to make the processes easier and less repetitive.
