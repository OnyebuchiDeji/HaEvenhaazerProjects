#	Brief

This practical demonstrates the creation of a simple client-server application.
The client-side displays a form that takes input and sends to server-side scripts.
These scripts take the information and stores it in a session that is created on execution of
that script.
The app allows one to sign-in and login, as well as displays the user's information.
It explores the use of sessions in user verification as well as persisting the access of the user
once logged in.
