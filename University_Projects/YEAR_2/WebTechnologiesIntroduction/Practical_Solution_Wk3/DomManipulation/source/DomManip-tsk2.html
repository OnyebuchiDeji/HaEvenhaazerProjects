                Preaching By Prophet Lovy

                Genesis 1: 1-5 :-:
                In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form
                and void, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water.
                And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
                And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.
                And God called the light day and the darkness He called night.
                And the evening and the morning was the first day.

                <em>Understand this:</em>

                What was the first day?

                Was it not when the light shone and the LORD saaw that it was good?
                
                Traceback and ELaboration:

                In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. So, in the beginning and the first day are two different things in a human being's life.
                There are people who have a beginning but have never had a day.
                There are people who have never been in a day yet in their life.
                Everything they know is just to exist.
                In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. The earth already existed, but had never seen a day.
                Why? Because there was nothing happening on the earth; the earth was covered in water -- there was no life, nothing going on even though the planet could sustain life.
                
                One may have two hands, two feet, the strength, the breadth of life and yet still not living.
                So there is a contradiction here that though its your beginning it does not begin your day.
                It can be a new year yet people are still in the past, like 1985, 1992, 2020... why? Because their morning, day begun but they were opposed to their day; they are still stagnant.
                
                <em>Stagnancy is not necessarily because the devil blocked one, even though the devil is involved.
                But my day is determined by my spiritual progression.</em>
                This is why some people would desire, saying that if God blesses them with money their life will be complete.
                Then when the money comes they realise that it does not make alive; it does not do anything.
                <em>Understand these.</em>
                There are many wealthy, doing well, yet the most depressed and unhappy. But why?
                Because though physically they have all the resources, <em>their day has not started because they have not served any purpose.</em>
                
                This year must be a new beginning for me. It's not just about celebrating shoutiong, "Happy new year!" And making a new year resolution like,
                'I want a six pack.'
                One may have a siz-pack and still not get married.
                One may hav ethe best business plan and still not execute.

                As a man or woman, son or daughter, of God, understand that God already made the heavens and the earth. Everything that was to be was already there
                but the earth had never had a day. Angels already enjoyed a day. Life was already happening.
                But why is it that in the earth it never had a day? So because years are passing does not mean you have lived.
                One's neighbour may be in their day, yet another still hasn't started; that one is still in their beginning.

            <p class="paragraph">

                John 1:1 :-:
                In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.
                All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was the light and the light was the life of men.
                And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkeness comprehended it not.
                This was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light that all men  through him might believe.
                He was not that light but came to bear witness of that light.

                As far as God is concerned <em>In the Beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God, and everything was by the Word
                    and the Word produced light and that light was the life of all men.
                </em>

                As far as God is concerned there is only one day. The day, as far as God is concerned is rthe day Jesus stepped on the earth.
                To Him, when He made the earth, it was still in the beginning of the day.
                That is why the bible says, "We are in the end of days" -- we are heading towards the evening.
                As far as God is concerened, when Genesis 1 happended, it was still the morning. The evening and the morining it was the first day.
                Nothing interesting happended in the world because Adam failed. So Adam was in the morning but nothing happended in the morning because everything was at pause because
                no human being could serve the purpose that they were created for because every human being was destined for hell.
                So as far as God was concerned, it was still just morning, nothing could happen because, htough every seed was in Adam, noone could fulfill any prupose.
                It did not matter that Moses came, it was still not enough. It did not matter that Aabraham came, it was still not enough; nobody would be saved.
                When Jesus came, now the earth actually begun. And why? Because He came and gave life and life more abundantly. So everyone before Jesus had no life.
                So they did not startt to live yet; they were preparing for the day to come that men would begin to live.

                <em>So Jesus comes and we become born again, beginning our day.</em>
                So, now we are actually beginning our day. Before we were just existing. Then, as far as God is concerned we were nobody, like a breadth.
                But now that we are born again there is eternity that has entered us. He produce something that is eternity.
                Now we can actually live; we will not die, nothing like that can happen to me. I can serve an eternal purpose and live and engage with this God
                for eternity.

                As far as God is concerned, men were not living.
                A day with Him is like a thouaand years and a 1000 years is as a day to Him.

                Adam, Methuselah, these did not even live to a day.
                In Genesis 6 God shortens the years of man not to go beyond a hundred and something.
                So we only live a few minutes, some seconds in God's sight. David understood this revelation and said, "Who is man that you care for him
                or the son of man that you visit  him? His life is but a vapour. In the morning it is here and in a few hours it is gone."
                As far as God is concerned all the events we are seeing are perhaps about to get to the evening.

                According to the standard of what God made, humans are not living.
                We are waiting for the new heavens and a new earth where there is no suffering and then we will live.
                But whoever receives the Lord Jesus actually begins true life; we actually start to become alive.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">

                We can all start the year the same. But within the first week there will be a big difference between us and other people. But why is this so?
                It is because how my spiritual life is moving determines what is going to happen in the physical. <em>If God almighty is concerened about me living
                then it means I have not lived yet.
                </em>
                The bible says, "Joy comes in the morning." He is not saying, joy comes when the sun rises. The interpretation of the word 'Morning' shows that it has nothing to do with daylight.
                <em>Because when God said "Let there be light" and He saw that the light was good, <i>then</i>, the evening and the morning were the first day.</em>
                So the calendar of what determines what the day is has nothing to do with the sun, the moon, the month, January, February, 2021, 2020, does not determing any of those things.

                Am I flowing with the light? That is the question. The light shineth in darkeness and the darkeness could not understand it.
                This is what it means: Jesus came into the world and gave a path to true life; it is among human beings but they do not understand it; they do not know how to tap into it.
                Because that light is the life (light) of all men but no man is accessing it except those who are born again.

                So this year, the dawn that produced everything is in Jesus. That same light form Genesis 1 is still beaming on the earth. But those who get born again are those who have entered that light.
                If thisyear would produce anything of significance for me, it must be a year that I experience the presence of God.
                
                I must be involved with God. If I do not be involved with God, any physical achievement I may ever have will not equate to purpose or to life.
                This is why David said, "Father, let Your face shine upon me." He understood that the light is not coming from the sun or the moon but from the very face of the Lord Jesus.

                I must be willing to say, "Lord, I am going to do something diferent. I am not only going to pray as all depends on you because it depends on you anyway."
                "But I am also going to work with my prayer; I am going to pray and also act; I am not going to act without prayer."
                The moment one reduces prayer, they reduce their spiritual life, reducing the content of the life that pushes them forward.
                God Himself could not do anything on the earth until He commanded light to shine on the earth.
                The reason why business deals of some fail is because they are praying to God but not allowing the light of Christ to shine.
                If the light of the Lord Jesus shines from His throne into my life, everything will have clarity, everything would have direction, everything would have change.
                I will know what to do, when to do it, how to do it. There would be things that I will be able to do simply because I am in the light.

                <em>There is something very important that I need to know: </em>
                What is the sign that God has already prepared for the light that should come upon me: When my life has no form, when things are chaotic in my life, when I am drowning in bills, having marital problems
                children are going crazy, businesses are not working -- when things are without form it is a call that <em>I should call upon the light of Christ.</em>
                
                I need to be in the light of Christ because the only way those things are going to shift is not by fasting.
                There are people who fast and yet are away from God, praying but with no results.
                It is not just about prayer but saying, "Lord, I want to be in Your divine and eternal purpose."
                The reason the devil is called the prince of darkeness is because the <em>face of God no longer shines on him.</em>
                As far as God is concerned, he is already dead -- that's why he knows his time is short.
                So anyone not in the light, where are they?
                When Scripture says Satan is the god of this world, anyone in the world is already dead to God.

                These are the things to be aware of as a child of God:
                Am I in The Presence.
                When Moses saw the face of God, that light was captured on his face that when anyone saw him they saw that light.
                When the Lord Jesus -- the presence of the Father came down and He was speaking to His Father face to face -- Moses and Elijah came -- Jesus was transfigured.
                
                This year must be a year of transfiguration from me; a year of great change for mel a year of great elevation for me.
                THe only way these things are going to happen is this: am I ain the light or am I not?
                The light doesn't mean 'do what everyone is doing,' but, do what God wants me to do.
                The light doesn't mean 'copy what everybody else iss doing,' but do what God wants me to do.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">

                Christians usually fail because of this excuse: "Men of God suffer the most battles."
                But this is not true because evrybody on the earth suffers battles. If anything, people in the world suffer the exceedingly.

                The greatest secret is this:
                Whoever is in the light, the light casts away every darkness. Light and darkness can never mix. Difficult situations does not mean one is not in the light.
                The evidence of the light is that every time there is a difficult situation, we always overcome. The light will always push me into my purpose and I will always succeed.
                Difficult situations does not mean I am not in the light, and difficult situations will never stop the Lord's purpose in my life.
                Because I am in God's eternal prupose, so event the devil knows that he is wasting his time by doing anything.
                In fact, if I am in the light and problems come it is actually God sending the devil so that I can be upgraded.
                It is not because the devil saw me vulnerable.

                Job was minding his business, the devil was going back and forth on the earth, attacking, destroying, doing his thing, like a lion looking for whom he may devour.
                Yet he never messed with Job, why? Because "there was an edge of protection around him," light around Job. Because he was in thelight, everything was multiplying, multiplication because
                he was in the light.
                Then the Lord said to him when he appeared, "Have you seen my servant Job...?"
                the devil said, "Of course I have seen him," he said, "But he loves You becasue of what You have given him. Take away those things and see if he will love You." 
                He did not say, 'Take out your protection and see if he will love you'. The devil has no power to take. The only One has that power, it is God.
                
                The devil comes to steal, kill and destroy, but what is he stealing?
                The devil doesn't need money, nor does he need any material thing.
                The "steal" is tha the removes you from what God wants you to do, he steals one's purpose, deviates one's path.
                And because that one is out of the light, he will kill them -- not really because he is killing that one, but because they are on the wrong side of histoey, he is going to die
                and so that one too is going to die. He is looking for who will go down with him and then to destroy them, the eternal damnation.
                
                For example:
                One has a plantation, an acre, but everything is in a dome that has no light, nothing will grow.
                Why? Because the plant needs light to follow.
                The Lord Jesus says the Kingom of God is like a treee, but why? Because for a tree to flourish, it must follow the light.

                To flourish this year, to grow this year, for something of significance to happen this year, I must desire the presence of God.
                
                Psalms 4:4-6 :-:
                Stand in awe and sin not. Commune with your own heart upon the bed and be still. Selah.
                Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord. There be many that say, 'Who would show us any good?'
                Lord lift thou up th elight of thine countenance upon us.
                Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than the time that their corn and their wine increased.
                I will both lay me thou in peace and sleep, for Thou, Lord, only make me lay down in safety.
                
                So many are saying, 'Will anything good happen?'
                Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.
                Now, there is peace in me.
                You have given me gladness more than when I have harvest. I willl sleep in peace becasue of Your face.

                The reason Christians don't have peace is because the light of God is not shinning on them.
                They are worried about tomorrow becasue they do not know what will happen tomorrow because there is no light.
                
                This year I will see things significant, I will see things that I did not see other years.
                I will do these things I have learnt.
                If there is no light there is no peace.
                If there is no presence of God there is no security.
                I am not afraid of anybody doing anything to me or stopping what God is doing, because whatever is started by God, He will finish the good work
                that He begun in me.
                Every work I do will finish; I will start and finish them in the light.
                I will do things of significance and become what God has called me to become, I must get back on the right track.

                This year and every year, I will not talk about plans, I will put them before God and execute them as He tells me to do.
                It is not about 'I will do', but 'doing' -- not 'I will pray', but 'praying'.
                The frutifulness and blessing I will experience in this year will be exceeding. Be in the light.

                Fixed the issue that when I tried to change the color via the input and the buttons....
                the color will change but then immediately dissapear.
                This is because in the code below, I wrapped them in a form html element.
                Along with its action and method attributes.
                We know that a form takes the value and sends it over to the server side.... something about that...
                caused the changing of the style colors not stay.
                Sol:
                Changed it from <form class="form-body"> to <div class="form-body">
             -->
