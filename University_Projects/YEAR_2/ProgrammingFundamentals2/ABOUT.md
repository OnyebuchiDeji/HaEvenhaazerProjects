#	Brief

This is the second part of the programming fundamentals module. It goes indept into programming, looking at data structures and algorithms.

Here we further explored the Object Oriented Programming principles in building modular systems that implement structures such as dynamic arrays,
queues, dequeues, stacks, linked lists -- linked lists made with cyclic buffered queues and linked lists that use references -- and trees, binary search trees,
and Bayer & MCreight trees.
We also learnt various algorithms: sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, q-sort, etc., and searching algorithms like
the naive linear search, sentinel linear search and binary search, with the use of recursive forms and iterative forms.


All the practicals ar ethe tasks given to students. All of them are completed.
