#	Brief

This was the first practical: it was basically as a refresh for the students' knowledge
on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Here, I make a single page application that with responsive layouts, and I document
the journey including issues encountered in the `DOCS.md`, including what I previously named the project.


These scripts will have to be run in a local server; I used xampp.

The entry point is the main.html. You have to start from this page for the app to work properly.
