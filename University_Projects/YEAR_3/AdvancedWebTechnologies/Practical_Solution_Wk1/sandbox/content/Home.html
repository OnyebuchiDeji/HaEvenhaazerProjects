        <p>
            Welcome to my website.
            This site is created following the various
            practical tasks from the modules, CSC-20021 and
            CSC30025. Here, I demonstrate the various skills learnt
            during the course of these modules in the scripting and styling
            languages, HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            As can be seen, I did not use any third party librarires for the styling
            but used one I created, hence in terms of functionality it is quite limited.
            However, these custom styling techniques are mine, and the trouble that came with
            getting a suitable result was worth it.
            My reasoning behind this was seeing how much freedom I had in working
            with HTML and CSS and to explore.

            How To Navigate The Site
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the Home Page.
            Various layouts can be chosen based on the Class Type you choose for the body of the DOM
            of the 'Main.html' page.
            Also, depending on the layout, there are top, bottom, and side navigation bars that have all
            the functionality of generic navigation bars.
            If you edit their HTML files, you can expand the content, but the functionality remains.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, on the navigation bars, there are links to this Home Page,
            to the About page, to the 'My Hobbies' page, and to a last page that lists the links
            to every project task I have completed during the course of my two modules.

            By clicking these links and accessing those pages, the tasks can be evaluated.

        <p>
            Making this website was very challenging.
            I would say the most challenging aspect was the CSS.
            But the most fun and challenging was the JavaScript.
            More of this is on my <a href="#" class="MainBodyNavLink">About</a> page.
