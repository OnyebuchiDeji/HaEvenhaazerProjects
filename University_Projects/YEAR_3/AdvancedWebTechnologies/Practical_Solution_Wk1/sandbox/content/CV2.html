    <h2>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>I am a student now in my final year of study for a BSc. degree in Computer Science and Neuroscience at Keele
        University. I am currently on a journey to learn skills of all kinds, one that commenced little before
        graduating from secondary school as an encouragement from my teachers, and have over my two years of study,
        become accustomed to the requirements of the corporate world, and its fast-paced working ethics. Thus, I seek a
        job where my skills in Programming and IT, and my transferable skills, can contribute to visions and where I can
        gain more experience, knowledge, and further skills, while making an earning.</p>

                ### Skills Gained
                • Programming skills: Java, C++, Python. For over two years now I have practiced on Python and C++,
                looking at AI and ML, networking and Computer Graphics as personal study while doing much of Java as
                part of my course and covering the Theory behind AI and Networking.</p>
            <p>• Cyber Security: the use of Linux and various tools used for monitoring processes, resources, and
                transactions on a device. The theory behind robust security models have been revealed to me, and the
                engaging tutorials on TryHackMe are both refreshing my memory and teaching me new things.</p>
            <p>• Further Programming skills: Exposed to Website design with JavaScript HTML &amp; CSS, PHP.</p>
            <p>• Teamwork: I have this experience through group projects and activities.</p>
            <p>• Software development skills: The Agile and SCRUM approach to project development: Creation and design

                tailored to user needs.</p>
            <p>• Data transmission and Computer Networks: Understanding of the OSI models.</p>
            <p>• (Neuroscience) Scientific Research Skills: Reading papers and, analysing them, and making summaries on
                them. Also, obtaining experimental data, compiling and Using Data Processing tools like Microsoft Excel
                to analyse and present the data in a meaningful form.</p>
            <p>• (Neuroscience) Presentation of analysed data in an audience-friendly and captivating way using MS
                PowerPoint.</p>
            <p>• Time Management: I had to finish projects before deadlines and work finish laboratory sessions within
                the allotted time, so I learnt to delegate time to each activity while working actively to get them
                done. Also, I employed regular study periods to keep up to date with my studies, and setting daily
                goals, writing them down.</p>
            <p>• Trust Worthiness: In the IT role, I was given the responsibility over every device. The IT teacher I
                worked under rarely did with the devices. Any updates to be done, and apps to be installed, I was
                entrusted to do.</p>

    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>Assistant Administrator and Assistant IT Teacher | Greenoak International School Primary Within 2021 for 4 Weeks
        This is the Primary branch of the teaching institution or school I learnt under for 6 years, from 2015 to 2021.
        The Institution is situated in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and are a renowned organization with affiliation with
        University of Cambridge and part of the Council of British Schools (COBIS).
        I worked first in the role of an Assistant Administrator in the first term of my work experience. Then I was put
        in the role of assistant IT teacher for the second.</p>
    <h3>Duties, Accomplishments, Skills Gained</h3>
    <p>• Was awarded a certificate for distinct performance in the roles I was assigned to, both in assisting teachers
        and in patience with students, as well as conscientiousness in carrying out my duties.<br>
        • Communication skills: In the administrator role, I was required to effectively relay messages between staff
        and oversaw keeping staff up to date with approaching events via the notice board. Then in the IT teacher role,
        I was tasked to teach students and explain concepts. I was also to assist them when my superior was
        teaching.<br>
        • Punctuality: Also, I oversaw documenting staff attendance – and because it was the period with Covid-19, I
        oversaw keeping records of their temperatures. Likewise in the assistant teacher role, I was to arrive on time
        to check the working conditions of the computers in the computer laboratory before classes commenced. I was to
        be early to check all staff temperatures on time to not interrupt teachings and activities.<br>
        • IT skills: In the administrator role, I assisted my superior in fixing some IT issues on her computer.<br>
        • Time management and organisation: Lastly, in the administrator role, I oversaw organising student records,
        sorting them in order. The records were physical records. There were many so I needed to divide the workload and
        set a plan on how much work to finish when.<br>
        • Trust Worthiness: In the IT role, I was given the responsibility over every device. The IT teacher I worked
        under rarely did with the devices. Any updates to be done, and apps to be installed, I was entrusted to do.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
    <p>• Basketball. I did a lot of this during secondary school (senior high school). Participated in inter-team
        competitions within the school, against a mix of teams formed with students of different age groups. My team and
        I got second place in our game.<br>
        • Pencil Drawing: It’s a skill I picked up from childhood. Basically, I can draw anything while I observe it
        almost accurately. I enjoy drawing nature the most.<br>
        • Music: Picked this also during childhood. But recently learnt to make good affirmations about myself with
        singing as it motivates and encourages.<br>
        • Piano: Picked this up recently too, during university study. I am improving constantly.</p>
