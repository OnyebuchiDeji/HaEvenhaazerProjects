        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This static website was created using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
            I created my own Styling Library which I call <i><b>Briygnonem</b></i>
            for the different DOM elements that I utilize during the course of this project.
            The method of design for the architecture of this website is unique.
            I'll explain this.

        <h2>Design Method</h2>
        <p>
            This site separates from other sites by utilizing more
            modular techniques to reduce the amount of redundant code
            that is prevalent in regular HTML websites. 
        </p>

            <h3>Client Side Design</h3>
            <p>
            It does this by
                using JavaScript to load the HTML content of different parts
                of the website into a single HTML file which, here, I call 'main.html'.
                Page parts or elements such as the TopNavbar, Sidebar, and BottomNavbar are
                loaded by scripts into this main file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, the different content, such as the content of the Home page, the About page,
                the 'MyHobbies' page, and the Projects List page are loaded into this single
                HTML file in the same way.
                Thus, the site utilizes local memory storage to enable persistence of recently visited pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Server Side Design</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike normal methods, this website is designed
                to not embed PHP into the DOM code.
                Hence, rather, when a Page is loaded, the JavaScript sends
                the appropriate request to the PHP of the server side.
                It does this for forms and any other function that requires
                communication with the server scripts.
                
                All PHP code is separate and structured in a modular way such that each script
                takes in parameters that specify what function it will perform.
                Any data that is needed to be displayed in the DOM is returned to the JavaScript
                that requested the data, and the data is used to populate the current DOM appropriately.
