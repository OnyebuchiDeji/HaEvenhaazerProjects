		<h2>What are My Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			Seeing that hobbies are what one enjoys to do in their
			past time, I might have to think a little.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first hobby to come to mind is drawing.
			Drawing has been my favorite thing to do since I was little.
			We'd take picture dictionaries and encyclopedias and draw all the animals
			and plants.
			Then, we were not so much keen on aethetics such as shadows that make things look realistic, as
			we were only drawing the outlines of the pictures --- I mean, most of the pictures were vector
			art with colourings; they didn't really extenuate the 3d aspects.
			Also, by we, I mean my siblings and I. We'd do drawing competitions and the one with the most accurate
			drawing wins.
			I didn't want to brag then, but I was pretty sure mine was the best.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the topic here is current hobbies, I don't want to include anime, movies, or video games.
			Though there was a time in my childhood I did and could enjoy it. Now it's not so any longer.
			However, I like listening to music. What kind of music will not be disclosed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then there is my botanist hobby.
			During a certain period of my life, I found that I liked planting seeds.
			The process of their growth was so fun especially because I could observe in real time
			what I saw in my textbooks.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another is one which I'd call a "hobby", but one I am not that fond of telling: <b>Collecting Magnets</b>.
			Yes, for the longest time since I was little, I was mesmerised by magnets. I wanted to 
			collect every magnet in the world.
			I often found myself sitting down, thinking of obtaining the coolest roundest and biggest magnets ever.
			Then I often played with them using my imagination. <i>sniff</i>, yeah. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Last is piano. It is something I have desired to learn since I was little. Only got into it
			recently during the summer holiday last year.
