This pracatical's tasks explore the use of AJAX to make asynchronous web requests
and using the requested data to populate the DOM.

It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used to separate the Presentation layer from
the Business (or Logical) layer because the PHP scripts obtain and organise the data,
and then the client-side javascript makes the request for that data and uses it to populate
the DOM. It can use the same data and present it in as many ways as possible. Moreover, it abstrcts
the organisation of the data from the client-side.
