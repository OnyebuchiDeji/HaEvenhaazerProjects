#	Brief

This practical explores different methods to achieve search engine optimization.

The first implementation of the methods start from Task2. It involves adding metadata to the top of the
html page: metadata for the page's description and those for keywords.
Also, adding alt text to images and titles to different page elements helps the SEO.

The second method is by adding links in the page to resources related to what your page is about. This is shown in Task3.

There are more methods than these listed, such as adding a XML or HTML sitemap to the page's directory. But I didn't implement
that in this practical. The sitemap would contain a list of the different web pages related to one's website.
