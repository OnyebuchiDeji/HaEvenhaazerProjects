This is the final project for the Games Computing module of Year 3.

Students were tasked to create a 3D game of their own choosung using C++ and any 3D engine.

The game I created was called the Pisa's Rocket, an arcade game inspired by flappy bird and geometry dash.
The name, though, seems intuitive as the rocket is always going against gravity while dodging projectiles.
